"""How the last game run ended, for the start screen: read from its log (logs/mkw.log, which the next Play moves to
mkw.1.log) and matched against the known errors of tools/github/signatures.toml, the list the issue bot answers with.

Why: by 14/11/2026 issues came in at 40-68 a day, 15 % of them a known error already tracked or fixed in a newer
release. Told at the next start that it is known (and where it is followed, or that an update fixes it), a player
need not open another issue; an unknown error points to the bug form with the log.

Output: one line on stdout, run with the package's Python by runtime/ui/launcher/launcher_lastrun.cpp:
  "clean"                    the run ended normally (window closed, or the game exited)
  "known <issue>"            a known error; the issue that follows it
  "fixed <issue> <tag>"      a known error fixed in a release newer than --version
  "crash"                    it stopped with an error no signature names
  nothing                    no log, or it ended without a word (killed, power off): nothing to say
Exit code 0 unless the arguments are wrong.

Usage: python -I lastrun.py --game DIR --version VER
