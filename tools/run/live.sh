# A game run that stays up for inspection through its control FIFO (runtime/core/base/ctl.c): screenshots, frame dumps,
# flight dumps and presses go to it with tools/run/ctl.sh, each in seconds, instead of a new run replaying the boot
# and the menus to reach the screen (60-90 s per look).
# Usage: tools/run/live.sh NAME [SECONDS]   (default 900; then the run is killed). Extra env (MKW_*) passes
# through; the defaults are those of the race runs (720p romfs overlay, 768 MiB of sparse tiles, BC1 off).
# Stop: tools/run/ctl.sh NAME stop. Log: build/run/NAME.log, FIFO: build/run/NAME.ctl.
# LIVE_WRAP: a command build/mkw runs under, e.g. an HDR display for a machine without one:
#   LIVE_WRAP="gamescope --backend headless -W 1280 -H 720 --hdr-enabled --hdr-debug-force-support --" (gamescope's
#   Vulkan layer on with ENABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=1, exported before live.sh).
# LIVE_BIN: another runtime than build/mkw, e.g. a prepared player folder of another game version
#   (LIVE_BIN=scratchpad/prep-linux-180/mkw: 1.8.0, whose game code build/mkw does not carry). A runtime from a release
#   AppImage links the sysroot's libvpx.so.6 and SDL3, which only the AppImage's lib/ has: LIVE_LIB=<that lib/> (e.g.
#   from `AppImage --appimage-extract 'lib/*'`) puts it first on the library path.
