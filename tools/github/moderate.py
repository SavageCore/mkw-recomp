"""Moderates the GitHub issues: labels each with the release it reports and its GPU, closes the empty and the ones asking
for the game, asks for the log, answers known errors (signatures.toml) and closes what a maintainer's reply settles.

Why: by 11/11/2026, 85 issues in two days; replies saying "Fixed in v0.1.4" or "same as #36" left them open, the same
crashes came in several issues, and RecompLauncher's reports (no form) got no labels. It runs from
.github/workflows/issues.yml on each event and once a day; by hand, it prints what it would do unless --apply.

Rules (the bot never comments where a maintainer already did):
- empty (under 30 characters, no attachment) or asking for the game: closed as not planned
- a bug report without a log and no replies yet: `needs-logs`, closed as not planned after 7 days without a reply from its author
- a known error: `duplicate` and "looks like #N", closed as its duplicate at once; its author's reply reopens it
  (14/11/2026: the 3 days, swept once a day and late, left 13 labelled duplicates open for up to 5 days)
- a report on a release older than the newest two, quiet for 3 days: `needs-retry`, asked to try the latest; closed as
  not planned after 7 days without a reply from its author (14/11/2026: 43 of 130 open issues were on 0.1.8 or older)
- a maintainer's reply with "Fixed in vX": closed if vX is out, else `fixed-next-release`; with "same as #N": duplicate
- a closed issue is reopened when its author, or anyone attaching a log, says it still happens
- a published release closes the `fixed-next-release` issues with a link to it
- a log from a run with mods on: a note asking for the same run without them (mods are their authors'); label `mods`

Usage: uv run tools/github/moderate.py issue N | comment N COMMENT_ID | sweep | release TAG | backlog [--apply]
