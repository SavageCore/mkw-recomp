// Guest setjmp/longjmp across lifted code.
//
// The guest's setjmp and longjmp (the SDK's, imported by main) run as lifted code and save and restore the guest
// registers themselves. What lifting breaks is longjmp's last instruction, BR x30 to the setjmp call's return
// address: that is the middle of a C function, not an entry, and the frame that would continue there was left long
// ago (a RET is a C return). 1.8.0 in Thai longjmps out of its text code to main+0x1bb0b34 (discussion 193).
//
// So recomp/gen.py builds every function that calls setjmp (its "owner") with all its labels and enters its body
// through rt_sj_owner, which keeps a host setjmp point in a frame that lives as long as the owner does. A dispatch
// that finds no function at an address inside a live owner is that longjmp (rt_sj_resume): the guest registers are
// restored already, so the host jumps back to the owner's frame and the body continues at c->pc. The idea is
// Hookshot's (GPL-3.0, docs/research.md); the code is ours. Every owner in MKW's main runs its work after setjmp
// and before it returns, so the owner's own frame is enough (Hookshot also wraps owners that return first).
