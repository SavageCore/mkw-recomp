# runtime/gfx/vk/diag

Back end diagnostics and measurements: frame dump, GPU time per pass and the submit timeline.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `vk_timeline.c` | `MKW_TRACE_TL=1` (measurement): each frame's submits on a single clock (game, replay, calibrated GPU, fence, waits), one line every 600 frames |
| `vk_dump.c`, `vk_dump_internal.h` | `MKW_DUMP=<frame>`: dumps a frame to PNG (RenderDoc does not capture this back end): passes, draws and dispatches; the header is what the parts share |
| `vk_dump_img.c` | Part of the dump: formats, copy of each image to a buffer and its PNGs |
| `vk_dump_buf.c` | Part of the dump: `MKW_DUMP_BUF`, a buffer range after each pass |
| `vk_dump_draws.c` | Part of the dump: `MKW_DUMP_DRAWS=<from>-<to>` (or an fs hash) copies the first colour target after every draw of passes in the range, splitting and resuming rendering for valid snapshots; `MKW_DUMP_DRAWS_RECT=x,y,w,h` only a rectangle of it |
| `vk_rtstats.c` | `MKW_RTSTATS=<N>` (diagnosis): one frame in N (default 60), each pass's targets and each dispatch's storage images are copied out and read on threads of their own; a NaN, an infinity or a constant target is logged once per target and program (`rtstats:` lines), so bugs that render without any error reach the log. Decodes with `vk_dump_img.c`'s formats |
| `vk_crumbs.c` | GPU breadcrumbs, on by default where `VK_AMD_buffer_marker` exists (AMD and current NVIDIA drivers; else `VK_NV_device_diagnostic_checkpoints`) (`MKW_GPU_CRUMBS=0` off, `ab` for its A/B): a start and an end mark around each upload batch, render pass and dispatch; at a device loss, or when the timeline has not moved for 5 s and the driver reports no loss (`vk_sync.c`; marker words only, NVIDIA checkpoints are readable only after a loss), the log names the last started and finished of each (size, formats, frame, a dispatch's compute program) and every mark between them, up to 200; with `MKW_GPU_CRUMBS_DRAW=1` draws too, with their vertex count or indirect argument addresses |
| `vk_passtime.c` | MKW's own: `MKW_PASS_TIMING`, GPU time by pass size (`=draw`: per program pair); measurement only |
| `vk_cs_hash.c` | `MKW_CS_HASH=<caller>`: hash of each input (storage, indirect arguments, uniforms) of the dispatches from that point of the game, before and after running; cactus flicker diagnostic |
| `vk_ubo_watch.c` | `MKW_UBO_WATCH=<address>`: the uniform block at that address as the replay binds it (the submit's copy) and whether game memory already held something else, once per frame; cactus flicker diagnostic |
