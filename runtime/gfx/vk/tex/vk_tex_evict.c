// on their next use), that nothing looked up in the last EVICT_IDLE submissions and the GPU did not write, go oldest
// use first. By the draw bindings' check alone (checked), a texture the replay used only as a copy source
// (vk_texture_get) looked idle while a part being recorded could name it: the likely cause of a view destroyed with
// that part not yet sent (MKW_GPU_GUARD, tsvp1 frame 1 477 and tsvp2, 08/11/2026, both after evictions). The race's downscaled render targets (bloom, the final composite's inputs) found the heap full of decoded
// ASTC textures and got no image: a black race (run-race4, 31/10/2026).
