"""Every setting the in-game menu writes to mkw.ini is a key the runtime reads back (runtime/core/base/cfg.c).

Why: HDR was in the menu's table but not in the list of known keys, so `HDR = off` written by the menu was dropped at
the next start with "unknown key 'HDR'" (#168, 13/11/2026).

Usage: uv run pytest tests/test_cfg.py
