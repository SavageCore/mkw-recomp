"""The game versions this port knows, keyed by the build id of exefs/main.

Why: each update of Mario Kart World is a different executable (other addresses, another sdk build, 1.8.0 adds
subsdk1, the nnEcli module), so everything tied to one build (the patch sites, the RomFS size the setup checks, the
number the runtime switches its fixed addresses on) is chosen here, from the dump itself, in one place. The runtime
keeps the matching rows for its own fixed addresses in runtime/core/boot/version.c, keyed by `number`.

Usage: from versions import detect; v = detect(exefs)  ->  Version, or ValueError for a build not listed.
       uv run recomp/versions.py [EXEFS]   prints the version of a dump.
